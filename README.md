# Why Being a Little Infantile is Actually Genius

Anyone who's worked in tech or an office environment with designers of any kind has probably noticed a childlike vibe—action figures, stickers, and even things stuck to the ceiling! Once, I even came across a taxi driver with a dashboard full of toys and colorful lights decorating the ride.

Of course, I couldn't resist asking him what his story was—it was clear he wasn't a typical taxi driver. And guess what I found out? Just as I suspected! The driver had once owned a quirky hat store in New York. He designed all the hats himself, and even his business card was anything but ordinary (if you could find it among the pile of toys).

But why is this? I decided to do some research.

One of the key figures who helped me understand this was **Bob McKim**—a creativity researcher in the 1960s and 70s. Bob led the design program at Stanford University and was a mentor to David Kelley, one of the founders of IDEO. As part of his research, Bob developed exercises to jump-start creative thinking and break down mental barriers. I decided to try some of his exercises with my coworkers during our weekly happy hour.

One exercise involves asking participants to draw as many uses as possible for 30 circles within one minute. Sounds easy, right? At first, everyone draws balls, suns, and flowers, but the last ten circles are where things get interesting.

In another exercise, he asked each participant to draw the face of the person sitting next to them within a minute. And guess what happened? Awkwardness—a lot of it. Comments like, "Sorry, man, I didn't mean to draw you like that," "I'm not good at drawing," and "You're much prettier in real life." This proves that as adults, we're afraid of others' reactions and being judged. This fear makes us hesitate to share our ideas, leading to less unique and bold thoughts, ultimately stifling our creativity.

Kids, on the other hand, are completely shameless and unembarrassed. They are proud of their drawings! Unfortunately, as they grow up, they lose this freedom and start worrying about what others think of them. The takeaway? To be more creative, we need to reconnect with our inner child! Research shows that the more playful we are, the more our creative abilities improve. Even Albert Einstein had something to say about this: 

> "Creativity is intelligence having fun."

## A Day at the Office: How to Boost Your Creativity

So, how can we awaken that dopamine living in our brains? (You know, the neurotransmitter responsible for creativity?)

- **Stay Happy and Positive:** It's good for your health, social life, and most importantly, your creativity.
- **Create a Fun Workspace:** Take notes from big companies. It's okay to dream!
- **Avoid Negative Influences:** We all know that one person at work who's always a downer.
- **Take Breaks:** Daydream, laugh, or even dance. As Taylor Swift says in her song, "Shake It Off!" It's scientifically proven to work.
- **Sketch Freely:** Draw quick sketches of whatever comes to mind without overthinking it.
- **Care Less About What Others Think:** It's okay to be a little childish; it actually helps!

At the end of the day, we're all just trying to find joy in the chaos.
